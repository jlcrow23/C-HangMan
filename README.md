# C-HangMan
Hangman game Built with C++

# Overview

A fun hangman game that can be played and changed to look how is desired.

For this I used:
Visual Studio
Visual Studio Code
Extensions needed for both

My purpose for writing this software was to learn how to use C++ and make a fun game.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

The tools used for this program were YoutTube, Visual Studio, W3Schools.com, and Microsoft.com.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Need to learn how to make sure the letters are capitalized without having capslock on.
- Would like to add more words.
- Understanding C++ just a little bit better.
